# Machine-Learning
This is a repository of some of my Machine Learning projects.


Some of the data used in these projects are for learning-purpose only, these data might not represent real world values.
Some of it was extracted from real applications, but also some was generated for study/testing.

You're welcome to make suggestions and point out mistakes, as well as giving some tips for code organization.
